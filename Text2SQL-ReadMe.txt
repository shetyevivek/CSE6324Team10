1) Python3 
2) PIP for python3
3) tkinter for python3

5) pip3 install openai
6) the openAI API key (ask for anyone in term10, we cannot share the key here)


run: 
//linux search code  "sqls = subprocess.check_output" make sure the string using "python3" instead of "python"
python3 Text2SQL.py.

//Windows // search code  "sqls = subprocess.check_output" make sure the string using "python" instead of "python3"
python Text2SQL.py.



// Text2SQl(ln2sqlmodule) we try this library too, only work for python2. discontinued.
// if you run code in windows 10. you may need to search code, change python3 to python.
